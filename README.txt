Modelling Telecom Resources such as network elements and Services such as the internet or wireless service is a universal requirement in Information and Communication Technology industry. IT systems carry out several business functions by operating on these models. Example of business functions are managing Quality of Services (QoS), monitoring Resource availability (e.g. network element outage), selling and fulfilling Telecom Services for customers e.g. the Home Internet Service. Thus, IT systems need models or software representation of these real life Resources and Services.
